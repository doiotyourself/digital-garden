Hi, how are you?

I'm Josh.

Welcome to my digital garden.

Please take a look around â€” you're in a web of  notes that I've written and collected on topics such as: the internet of things, home automation, self hosting, and do it yourself projects.

I hope you find something useful or entertaining.
