In this post I will outline my OPNsense configuration.

## Brief Overview of My Network

At home, I use OPNsense as my perimeter firewall. It's located at the boundary of my internet service provider's (ISP) network and my internal networks, which are listed in the table below:

| Name       | Description                                   | Why does it have a separate network?       | VLAN | Subnet           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---------------- |
| TRANSIT    | OPNsense and core switch                      | Simplify OPNsense/network configuration    | 96   | 192.168.96.0/24  |

## OPNsense configuration

OPNsense is setup as a router on a stick. 

### Interfaces

The OPNsense VM is assigned three virtual network adaptors in ESXi. One of the adaptors is the "on a stick" interface which split into an interface for vlan.
| Interface        | Description | IPv4 Address     | IPv6 Address |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| [LAN] em0        | OOB-MGMT    | DHCP4            |
| [OPT1] vmx0.99   | INB-MGMT    | 192.168.99.1/24  |
| [OPT2] vmx0.100  |             | 192.168.100.1/24 |
| [OPT3] vmx0.101  | SAND-PIT    | 192.168.101.1/24 |
| [OPT4] vmx0.102  |             | 192.168.102.1/24 |
| [OPT5] vmx0.103  |             | 192.168.103.1/24 |
| [OPT6] vmx0.104  |             | 192.168.104.1/24 |
| [OPT7] vmx0.105  |             | 192.168.105.1/24 |
| [OPT8] vmx0.106  |             | 192.168.106.1/24 |
| [OPT9] vmx0.107  | LOL-CATS    | 192.168.107.1/24 |
| [OPT10] vmx0.108 |             | 192.168.108.1/24 |
| [WAN] vmx1       |             | DHCP4            | DHCP6        |

#### LAN

- Network Adapter: VMXNET 3
- VLAN: 96
- IPv4 address: 192.168.96.96
- IPv6 address: tracks WAN

#### WAN

- Network Adapter: E1000E
- VLAN: untagged
- IPv4 address: DHCP
- IPv6 address: DHCPv6

### Static Route and Network Address Translation

As my internal network has multiple separate networks I need to tell OPNsense to route traffic to these networks through my core switch.

- First, in **System: Gateways: Single**, a gateway is created for my core switch `192.168.96.1`
- Then, in **System: Routes: Configuration**, create a route to my internal networks `192.168.96.0/20` via the newly created gateway

As my ISP only provides one IPv4 address I need to tell OPNsense  to provide network address translation (NAT) on outbound traffic from internal networks.

- In **Firewall: NAT: Outbound** select Hybrid outbound NAT rule generation and add rule:

### SSH Access

For ease of management, turn on SSH, securely.

- In **System: Access: Users** create a new user _josh_, member of group _admins_, and add my public ssh key.
- In **System: Settings: Administration** enable Secure Shell

### DHCP for IPv4

The following will setup an OPNsense service to provide IPv4 addresses to DHCP clients on the internal networks.

- Create a an ISC-DHCP configuration file `dhcpd.conf` for my internal networks
    `dhcpd.conf` example
- Copy the configuration file to OPNsense with ssh
    ```console
    $ scp /home/josh/Documents/dhcpd.conf josh@192.168.96.96:/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.opnsense.d/
    ```
- In **Services: DHCPv4: [LAN]** enable DHCP server on the LAN interface
- Check the log **Services: DHCPv4: Log File**

### Network Time Protocol Service

The following will setup an OPNsense to respond to NTP requests from all clients on the internal networks. Clients will no longer be able to make NTP requests directly to the internet.

- In **Services: Network Time: General** change interface to LAN and uncheck all check-boxes under Access restrictions
- In **Firewall: NAT: Port Forward** create a new rule to capture all NTP traffic.

### Unbound DNS Service

- In **System: Settings: General** add DNS server `1.1.1.1` which is provided by [Cloudflare and APNIC][].
